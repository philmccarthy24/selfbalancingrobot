## Introduction

A project to explore how self balancing vehicles like the Segway / hoverboards work. This will be a long running spare-time project.

## Hardware spec

The robot has been built using:

- 3 layers of MDF, the bottom 18mm thick and the top two 9mm thick
- 4 12mm diameter hollow aluminium poles 50mm in length slotted and bolted through the middle sheet to give strength and stability while keeping the assembly relatively lightweight - fully built, the robot has XX g mass.
- 28 25mm steel braces and 16 M4 bolts/washers/nuts to secure the poles to the boards.
- 2 6.5 inch 36v rated wheel hub motors taken from a broken hoverhoard bought off ebay for Â£20, each secured with 4 M8 bolts, washers and wing nuts.

See the mechanical drawings in the docs/mechanical directory for further details (created with [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/)). Here's a photo of the assembly during motor/ahrs testing:

## Electronics

The powertrain is 36v from two 18v LIon batteries I had knocking about from a dead electric screwdriver.

A Raspberry Pi 4 SBC is powered off this circuit via a 5v down-converter, and runs the control software. Connected to the Pi are:

- a FXAS2100 Gyroscope IC over I2C bus
- a FXOS8700 Accelerometer/Magnetometer IC over I2C bus
- a 18-56v [ODrive 3.6 BLDC motor controller board](https://odriverobotics.com) over a ground-loop isolated USB/serial link at 115200 baud

The sensor hardware containing the gyro/accelerometer/mag sensors is an [Adafruit NXP 9-DOF Breakout Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3463).

The wheel hub motors are driven by the ODrive at 36v.

## Software

The development system runs Raspian Buster, although I'd like to use something like BuildRoot for the final system (with a mostly read-only FS to prevent SD card wear).

The main functional components are:

- **sbrcontrollerd** - a Linux daemon written in C++ that manages the robot's hardware. It reads raw sensor data from the AHRS hardware in a near-realtime (highest scheduling priority) loop at 100Hz, filters it through the Madgwick fusion algorithm to yield physical orientation (roll/pitch/yaw), and controls the wheel hub motors' velocities/torque via a PID controller to maintain unit balance.
- **sbrui** - a Typescript React web UI served from Node.js, allowing the robot to be controlled remotely over WiFi, and for users to update settings easily.

gRPC is used to send data between the web application and the backend control daemon.

## Progress

- Mechanical frame built. Odrive and wheels installed, wiring complete.
- Temporary wiring to Pi4 and AHRS breakout, resting on middle section
- 36v bench power supply currently used instead of batteries
- 5v USB-C Pi4 power supply currently used instead of batteries
- Basic motor calibration done, tested moving hub motors using serial commands issued from Pi4 daemon. Optimisation required
- Daemon software mostly implemented
  - CMake build system
  - Factories
  - Logging via spdlog library
  - Unit tests via google test library
  - Performance unit tests written to test AHRS at rest and drive motors via ODrive
  - AHRS system to determine 3D space orientation written
  - AHRS sensor calibration (with tool) support
  - Motor controller api
  - Left to do: PID controller, gRPC service
- UI software started
  - Non-TS React interface started
  - Tested against a fake REST controller served by Node.js
  - Left to do: lots. remote control, settings, gRPC client, etc
- TO DO: Install AHRS breakout and Pi4 more permanently, install batteries and down-converter, then big job of optimising PID controller to make the robot stay up(!)
